# Chesstack Rules

Chesstack is a game similar to the age-old classic game, Chess. It’s traditionally played on a 5x5 game board, but is versatile enough to suit almost any situation. This guide will get you started with the ins and outs of Chesstack.

## Materials:
- A 5x5 game board of any kind.
- 2 groups of 5 differently colored cups that can easily stack on top of each other (10 total).
- This guide.

## Setup:
Place the board on the setup area, or construct it out of whatever materials you are using.
Put  the 5 cups of each color lining the each end of the board. The rows should be facing each other like the pawns at the start of a chess game.
Grab a friend and seat them behind their respective side of the board.

## Rules:
The goal of this game is to capture all of your opponents’ cups by moving and stacking them.
On your turn, you may move 1 of your cups or stack of cups to any space available for movement. The amount of spaces a cup is able to move depends on how many cups are in the stack you are moving. For example, a stack of 3 cups may move 3 spaces up, down, left, or right. Cups may loop around the sides of the board.
When a cup or stack of cups lands on a space with another cup on it, the cup is added to the bottom of the attacker’s stack. You may move cups onto your own pieces.
If a stack has 5 or more cups in it, then the stack can only move 1 space in any direction including diagonals. The amount of spaces a stack moves when over this amount never increases past 1 space.
Who controls a stack of cups is dictated by what color of cup is on top of the stack.
Advanced Rules

On some occasions, a regular game of Chesstack is either impossible or not wanted. Here, extra rules are presented that overwrite existing rules to provide a framework for variants of this game.
