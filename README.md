This repository is only a proof of concept. It is missing a multitude of features that would allow me to say that it is "complete."

# Chesstack Rules

Chesstack is a game similar to the age-old classic game, Chess. Itâ€™s traditionally played on a 8x8 game board, but it is versatile enough to suit almost any situation. This guide will get you started with the ins and outs of Chesstack.

## Materials:
- The link above
- This guide.

## Rules:
- Players take turns moving one cup stack that they own, depicted by the stacks color.
- The number of spaces a cup is able to move depends on how high a stack is.
  - For example a stack of 3 cups moves 3 spaces left, right, up, or down.
- When a cup (stack) lands on a space already occupied by another cup, the two cup (stacks) are added, and the color of the resulting stack is that of the landed cup.
  - For example, a blue cup lands on a stack of 3 orange cups. The resulting stack is 4 cups tall, and is blue.
- You may stack on your own cups
- Cup stacks may loop around the board
  - This excludes single stacks
- When a cup stack is equal to or exceeds the boards width (On a traditional 8x8 board, 8 cups tall) it becomes a Max Stack
  - Max stacks can move any distance up, down, left, or right
  - When Max Stacks capture other stacks, or are captured, they remain Max Stacks

## How To Win
To win you must do one of the following:
- Capture all of your opponent's pieces
- Cause a Checkmate condition, so that your opponent cannot make a move that will not result in the previous win condition
- A tie occurs if neither player cannot capture the other's pieces. For this to occur both players must agree to defeat.
